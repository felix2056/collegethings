                        <p class="p1">Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce
                            platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.</p>
                        <p class="p1">Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general
                            Shopify application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.</p>
                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="p1">Payment:</p>
                        <p class="p1">If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify
                            stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data
                            Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is
                            necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase
                            transaction information is deleted.</p>
                        <p class="p1">All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by
                            the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard,
                            American Express and Discover.</p>
                        <p class="p1">PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by
                            our store and its service providers.</p>

                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="p1">In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and
                            disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they
                            provide to us.</p>
                        <p class="p1">However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other
                            payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the
                            information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
                        <p class="p1">For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can
                            understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have
                            facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect
                            to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider,
                            then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that
                            service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
                        <p class="p1">As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a
                            payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in
                            completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation,
                            including the Patriot Act.</p>
                        <p class="p1">Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or
