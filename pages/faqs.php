                        <p class="p1">Often, when you order multiple items we utilize different distribution channels.
                            As such, many times each item will be shipped separately. You may receive one item before
                            the next. So don't panic if you don't receive all of your items at once…they will get to
                            you!</p>
                        <p class="p1"><b>How secure is my personal information?</b></p>

                            to protect our shoppers. You can verify&nbsp;this by looking up at your browser address bar
                            and seeing "https://" in front of our web address and the padlock icon as well. This ensures
